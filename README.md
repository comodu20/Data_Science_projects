🔬 Data Science Project Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my work in various domains of data science, ranging from predictive modeling and statistical analysis to machine learning algorithms. Each project aims to demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world problems, extract insights from data, and build robust analytical solutions.

🎯 About This Repository
This collection of projects highlights my practical experience with data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and interpretation. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of my thought process, methodologies, and the impact of the data-driven solutions I develop.

Each project folder typically contains:

Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) detailing the analysis.
Relevant datasets (if permissible and small enough).
Markdown files or comments explaining the process and findings.

📈 Predictive Analytics
Project focused on forecasting future outcomes for an E-Commerce company's operational improvement utilising various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

❓Problems
* Predicting customer purchase behavior to enhance e-commerce operational performance, utilising the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset"(Sakar, C. and Kastro, Y. (2018) ‘Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset’. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5F88Q.).
* Grouping the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" into meaningful labels for customer segmentation, aiding in enhanced personalisation in customer marketing
* The goal is to find the target customer groups, and to analyse whether a customer will finalise a transaction.

⚙️ Techniques
* 📊 Logistic Regression
* 🌳 Random Forest Classification
* 👥 Cluster Analysis

🪜 Methodology
* Applied Logistic Regression, a statistical method that estimates the probability of a specific event by applying a logistic function to predictor variables.
* Implemented Random Forest Classifier, an effective machine learning technique that employs multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting, especially in complex datasets. 
* These models were developed to predict customer purchase behavior
* Utilised K-Means and K-Modes Clustering to group similar objects based on their characteristics, aiding in recognising patterns within the data. The Elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters and avoid overfitting.

💡 Key Insights/Outcome
* The Random Forest Classification model outperformed the Logistic Regression model with a test accuracy of 89%.
* Feature Importance analysis identified key drivers like "Bounce Rates" and "PageValues".
* The study shows the model's potential to facilitate data-driven decision-making, enabling proactive problem-solving and resource optimisation.
